Project Overview

The project explores identity, community, and emotional path through animated typography. I employed the lyrics of Lana Del Rey's "Ride" because they were 
intimate and spoke of how it is to be seeking connection in an insane world. The design utilizes interactive text and motion to visually portray that feeling — 
no images, only words, color, and motion.
Every page has a line of the lyrics on it. One of the words in the line is click-able and goes on to the next page, making it an interactive and poetic experience.

Technical Overview

The project is built using HTML and CSS only.
It has three separate pages (index.html, page2.html, and page3.html), each of which is styled by a shared CSS file.
I used flexbox for layout, Google Fonts for dramatic and bold appearance, and CSS animations to add a lifelike touch to the text.
On hover, certain words sparkle and grow to invite interaction.
On the final page, the word "ride" becomes animate and zooms off the page, symbolizing motion and emotional freedom.
